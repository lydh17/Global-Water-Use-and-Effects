# **Global Water Use and Effects**
### **Contents**
#### The global water use repository contains an original CSV file filled with data provided by AQUASTAT. This data ranges from global water resource usage to water resource impact. Access to this original file can be found with this link: [Original AQUASTAT Data Set](AquastatOriginalData.csv)
#### The repository also contains a notebook that uses Python coding language to turn the original AQUASTAT dataset into two synthesized subsets used for analysis. Access to this Python notebook can be found with this link: [Python Notebook](PythonNotebook.ipynb)
#### The repository also includes two subsets of the original dataset from AQUASTAT created by the Python notebook. One subset focuses on the global dependency ratio of total renewable water resources and is linked here: [Dependency Ratio Subset](dependencyratio.csv) 
#### The other subset focuses on global agricultural water withdrawal and its drain on total renewable resources and is linked here: [Agriculture Water Use Subset](agriculturalwater.csv)
